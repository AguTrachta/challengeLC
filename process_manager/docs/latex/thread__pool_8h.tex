\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \doxylink{classThreadPool}{Thread\+Pool} class that manages a pool of worker threads. 

The \doxylink{classThreadPool}{Thread\+Pool} class allows for the parallel execution of tasks using a fixed number of threads. It supports adding tasks to a queue, which are executed by the worker threads. The pool can be stopped gracefully and can wait for all tasks to finish.
