\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Provides functionality for listing and retrieving system processes. 

This file defines the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classProcessListing}{Process\+Listing}} class, which allows for fetching and displaying a list of system processes along with their resource usage (CPU and memory). The processes are identified by their PID, and the resource usage statistics are calculated for each process.
